# mlr3cmprsk

![](reference/figures/warning.png) This package is **under development**

Package website: [release](https://mlr3cmprsk.mlr-org.com/)

`mlr3cmprsk` extends the [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) ecosystem
with a unified interface for machine learning in **competing risks
survival analysis**. It provides consistent task, learner, and
prediction abstractions, enabling seamless benchmarking, model
comparison, and integration with the broader `mlr3` framework.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mlr-org/mlr3cmprsk")
```
